### Project Title: Pyautogui Game Analyzer
========================================

A game-changing tool that lets you analyze and visualize your gameplay like never before!

### Description
----------------

Hey fellow gamers and developers! I built this to provide a simple yet powerful way to monitor your in-game activity, straight from the comfort of your desktop. With Pyautogui Game Analyzer, you can:

* Track mouse movements and clicks
* Capture and analyze pixel colors at specific locations on the screen
* Take screenshots of your gameplay (because who doesn't love a good screenshot?)

### Features
------------

One cool feature is our **real-time analysis**: with a single click, you'll get an updated view of your mouse position, RGB values, and even a preview of the color at that spot. Plus, take advantage of our **screenshot capabilities** to capture memories of your most epic gaming moments!

### Installation
---------------

To get started, make sure to:

* Install PyAutoGUI (`pip install pyautogui`) and PyQt6 (`pip install pyqt6`)
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/hasnocool/pyautogui_game_analyzer.git`
* Run the script using Python: `python game_analyzer.py`

### Usage
---------

Open a terminal, navigate to your cloned project directory, and execute the script. A beautiful GUI will appear, where you can:

* Press "Start" to begin real-time analysis
* Click "Stop" to pause it (because sometimes you just need a break)
* Take screenshots by clicking the "Take Screenshot" button
